JustLogin uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., invalid email address given, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with JustLogin's servers (these are rare).
